# Merge_Insert

The Merge-Insertion sort algorithm for sorting arrays. 

The algorithm behaves like mergesort on a macro level, but switches to insertion sort during recursive calls to a subarray of size less than S.

Merge_Insertion sort performs better than Mergesort in terms of key comparisons required for optimum S.
